# Task 5: Airflow Orchestration Framework - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Airflow orchestration framework for the real-time data pipeline. The framework provides dynamic DAG generation, custom operators, sensors for change-based triggering, and robust task dependency management.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Dynamic DAG Generator (`src/orchestration/dag_generator.py`)
- **DynamicDAGGenerator**: Creates Airflow DAGs from YAML configuration files
- **PipelineConfig**: Data class for pipeline configuration
- **Features**:
  - Loads pipeline configurations from YAML files
  - Generates DAGs with ingestion, transformation, and validation tasks
  - Supports configurable scheduling, retries, and dependencies
  - Compatible with Airflow 3.0+ (uses `schedule` instead of `schedule_interval`)
  - Automatic task dependency resolution

### 2. Custom Airflow Operators (`src/orchestration/operators.py`)
- **IngestionOperator**: Handles data extraction from various sources
- **TransformationOperator**: Executes dbt models and transformations
- **ValidationOperator**: Performs data quality checks and validation
- **SnowflakeOperator**: Executes SQL operations on Snowflake
- **DataQualityOperator**: Comprehensive data quality testing
- **Features**:
  - Integration with existing ingestion components
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - XCom integration for data passing between tasks
  - Configurable validation rules and quality checks

### 3. Change-Based Sensors (`src/orchestration/sensors.py`)
- **DataSourceChangeSensor**: Monitors data sources for changes
- **TableChangeSensor**: Monitors specific database tables
- **FileSystemChangeSensor**: Monitors file system changes
- **APIChangeSensor**: Monitors API endpoints for changes
- **CustomChangeSensor**: Generic sensor with custom detection logic
- **Features**:
  - Multiple change detection methods (timestamp, log-based, polling)
  - Configurable polling intervals and thresholds
  - Integration with change detection system
  - XCom storage of detected changes

### 4. Task Management System (`src/orchestration/task_manager.py`)
- **TaskManager**: Manages task execution, dependencies, and scheduling
- **ScheduleManager**: Handles pipeline scheduling logic
- **TaskDependency**: Represents task dependencies with various types
- **Features**:
  - Dependency graph construction and validation
  - Topological sorting for execution order
  - Cycle detection and validation
  - Task execution history and statistics
  - Support for various trigger rules (all_success, one_failed, etc.)

### 5. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_airflow_orchestration.py`)
- Comprehensive test suite covering all components
- End-to-end integration testing
- Mock implementations for testing without full Airflow setup
- Test cases for:
  - DAG generation from configuration
  - Task dependency resolution
  - Operator execution
  - Sensor functionality
  - Error handling and validation

## Configuration Support

### Sample Pipeline Configuration (`config/pipelines/sample_pipeline.yaml`)
- Complete example showing all configuration options
- Multiple data sources (database, API)
- Transformation pipeline with dbt models
- Data validation rules and quality checks
- Dependency management

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 3.1: Pipeline Task Execution
- ✅ Airflow executes tasks according to specified dependencies
- ✅ Dynamic task creation based on configuration
- ✅ Support for parallel and sequential execution

### Requirement 3.2: Task Failure Handling
- ✅ Configurable retry policies for each task type
- ✅ Error handling with detailed logging
- ✅ Circuit breaker patterns for system failures

### Requirement 3.3: Execution Metrics and Logging
- ✅ Structured logging with JSON format
- ✅ Task execution history and statistics
- ✅ Integration with existing logging system

### Requirement 3.4: Error Messages and Remediation
- ✅ Clear error messages with context
- ✅ Detailed failure information in logs
- ✅ Remediation guidance through error classification

## Technical Highlights

### Airflow 3.0 Compatibility
- Updated to use `schedule` parameter instead of deprecated `schedule_interval`
- Compatible with modern Airflow features and APIs
- Proper handling of DAG constructor parameters

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks when Airflow is not installed
- Mock implementations for testing environments
- Comprehensive exception handling and logging

### Flexible Configuration
- YAML-based pipeline definitions
- Environment-specific configurations
- Extensible operator and sensor framework

### Integration with Existing Components
- Seamless integration with ingestion system
- Uses existing data source and change detection components
- Maintains consistency with project architecture

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Pipeline
```yaml
name: my_pipeline
description: My data pipeline
schedule_interval: "0 2 * * *"
sources:
  - source_id: my_db
    source_type: database
transformations:
  - model_name: staging_data
dependencies:
  transform_staging_data: [ingest_my_db]
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_airflow_orchestration.py -v
```

### Health Check
The framework includes built-in health checks and monitoring capabilities.

## Next Steps
The orchestration framework is now ready for:
1. Integration with Snowflake data loading (Task 6)
2. dbt transformation framework setup (Task 7)
3. Comprehensive error handling and monitoring (Task 8)
4. Production deployment and testing (Tasks 9-15)
