# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive real-time, end-to-end data pipeline that enables scalable data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration for analytics use cases. The pipeline will integrate Python, Snowflake, dbt, and Apache Airflow, with full containerization using Docker, CI/CD pipeline automation, comprehensive testing, and production-ready documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to ingest data from multiple sources in real-time using change-based triggers, so that I can provide up-to-date analytics to business stakeholders efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is available from source systems THEN the pipeline SHALL ingest data within 30 seconds of availability
2. WHEN data changes are detected in source systems THEN Airflow DAGs SHALL trigger automatically to process only changed data
3. WHEN multiple data sources are configured THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent ingestion without data loss
4. WHEN source data format changes THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing valid records
5. WHEN no data changes are detected THEN the system SHALL skip unnecessary processing to optimize resource usage
6. WHEN ingestion fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert on persistent failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to transform raw data using dbt models, so that I can create clean, business-ready datasets for analytics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw data is ingested THEN dbt SHALL apply transformations according to defined models
2. WHEN transformation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and halt downstream processing
3. WHEN data quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL quarantine bad data and alert data stewards
4. WHEN transformations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL update data lineage metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to orchestrate the entire pipeline using Airflow, so that I can manage dependencies, scheduling, and monitoring in a centralized way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline tasks are defined THEN Airflow SHALL execute them according to specified dependencies
2. WHEN a task fails THEN Airflow SHALL retry according to configured retry policies
3. WHEN pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL log execution metrics and status updates
4. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN Airflow SHALL provide clear error messages and remediation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to store processed data in Snowflake, so that I can leverage cloud-native scalability and performance for analytics workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transformed data is ready THEN the system SHALL load it into appropriate Snowflake tables
2. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL use efficient bulk loading methods
3. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle upserts and deduplication correctly
4. WHEN storage costs are a concern THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention policies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the entire pipeline containerized with Docker, so that I can ensure consistent deployments across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the pipeline THEN all components SHALL run in Docker containers
2. WHEN containers start THEN they SHALL have all required dependencies and configurations
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN containers SHALL support horizontal scaling
4. WHEN environment changes THEN containers SHALL maintain consistent behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure pipeline reliability and catch issues before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN unit tests SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
2. WHEN pipeline components are integrated THEN integration tests SHALL validate end-to-end functionality
3. WHEN data transformations are modified THEN data quality tests SHALL validate output correctness
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable time limits for CI/CD integration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that I can deploy changes safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN CI pipeline SHALL run automated tests and quality checks
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build and push Docker images to registry
3. WHEN deployment is triggered THEN CD pipeline SHALL deploy to target environment with zero downtime
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to previous stable version

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a new team member, I want comprehensive documentation and setup instructions, so that I can quickly understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the repository THEN README SHALL provide clear setup and usage instructions
2. WHEN setting up locally THEN documentation SHALL enable successful setup within 30 minutes
3. WHEN understanding architecture THEN documentation SHALL include system diagrams and component descriptions
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN documentation SHALL provide common issues and solutions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want reliable data availability, so that I can perform analytics without worrying about data freshness or quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying analytics tables THEN data SHALL be no more than 1 hour old during business hours
2. WHEN data quality issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear data quality metrics and alerts
3. WHEN historical data is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain data history according to retention policies
4. WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN data availability SHALL be maintained through redundancy

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting, so that I can proactively manage pipeline health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline components run THEN the system SHALL collect and expose performance metrics
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to appropriate channels (email, Slack, etc.)
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
4. WHEN capacity limits are approached THEN the system SHALL alert before resource exhaustion
